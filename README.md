# Crypto Wallet Behavior Analysis

A data science project that analyzes Ethereum wallet transaction behavior using on-chain data. This project uses clustering and feature engineering to uncover patterns in user behavior such as frequent traders, holders, and gas spenders.

## 🔍 Project Goals
- Collect and preprocess Ethereum wallet transaction data
- Engineer features such as transaction frequency, volume, token diversity
- Segment wallets using unsupervised learning (clustering)
- Visualize patterns across different wallet types

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Python**, **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**
- **Etherscan API**, **Plotly**, **Streamlit (optional)**
